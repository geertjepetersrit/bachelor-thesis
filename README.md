# bachelor-thesis

In this bachelor thesis, an AI mental health chatbot will be built.
The chatbot will be able to detect SOS signals of poor mental health and provide the appropriate hotline to the user.

Used software:
* ```Composer```: this is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It manages the libraries your project uses and it will install/update them for you.
* ```Yii```: a PHP framework to build websites.

_Needs to be updated further_
