### Introduction
In this bachelor thesis, an AI mental health chatbot was built. The chatbot is called M.A.X. (Mental AI Access).
M.A.X. is able to detect SOS signals of poor mental health and provide the appropriate hotline to the user.

*DISCLAIMER: Please note that the purpose of M.A.X. is assisting people to seek help, instead of providing a cure. In other words, M.A.X. is simply an additional tool for mental health care and not a replacement. Use at your own risk. M.A.X. is neither responsible nor liable in any way for any harm caused.*
