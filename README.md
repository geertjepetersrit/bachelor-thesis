### Introduction
In this bachelor thesis, an AI mental health chatbot will be built.
The chatbot will be able to detect SOS signals of poor mental health and provide the appropriate hotline to the user.

*DISCLAIMER: Please note that the purpose of M.A.X. is to assist people to seek help, instead of providing a cure. In other words, M.A.X. is simply an additional tool of mental health care and not a replacement. Use at your own risk.*

### Used software:
* ```Composer```: this is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It manages the libraries your project uses and it will install/update them for you.
* ```XAMPP```: provides a local host which runs on an Apache test server.
* ```Watson Assitant Lite```: a product of IBM to build chatbots. The ```Lite``` plan is free.
* ```Atom```: A text writer to write HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP code.

The [website](http://maxthechatbot.herokuapp.com/) is hosted on ```Heroku```. This is a cloud computing platform that allows developing and deploying websites.

### Installation
