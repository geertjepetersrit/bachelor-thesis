### Introduction
In this bachelor thesis, an AI mental health chatbot is built. The chatbot is called M.A.X. (Mental AI Access).
M.A.X. is able to detect SOS signals of poor mental health and provide the appropriate hotline to the user.

*DISCLAIMER: Please note that the purpose of M.A.X. is to assist people to seek help, instead of making a diagnosis or providing a cure. In other words, M.A.X. is simply an additional tool of mental health care and not a replacement. Use at your own risk.*
